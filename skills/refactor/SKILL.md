# Refactor

## Overview

Improve code structure and readability without changing external behavior. Refactoring is gradual evolution, not revolution. Use this for improving existing code, not rewriting from scratch.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Code is hard to understand or maintain
- Functions/classes are too large
- Code smells need addressing
- Adding features is difficult due to code structure
- User asks "clean up this code", "refactor this", "improve this"

## Refactoring Principles

### The Golden Rules

1. **Behavior is preserved** - Refactoring doesn't change what the code does, only how
2. **Small steps** - Make tiny changes, test after each
3. **Version control is your friend** - Commit before and after each safe state
4. **Tests are essential** - Without tests, you're not refactoring, you're editing
5. **One thing at a time** - Don't mix refactoring with feature changes

### When NOT to Refactor

```
- Code that works and won't change again (if it ain't broke...)
- Critical production code without tests (add tests first)
- When you're under a tight deadline
- "Just because" - need a clear purpose
```

## Refactoring Steps

### Safe Refactoring Process

```
1. PREPARE
   - Ensure tests exist (write them if missing)
   - Commit current state
   - Create feature branch

2. IDENTIFY
   - Find the code smell to address
   - Understand what the code does
   - Plan the refactoring

3. REFACTOR (small steps)
   - Make one small change
   - Run tests
   - Commit if tests pass
   - Repeat

4. VERIFY
   - All tests pass
   - Manual testing if needed
   - Performance unchanged or improved

5. CLEAN UP
   - Update comments
   - Update documentation
   - Final commit
```

## Refactoring Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] Functions are small (< 50 lines)
- [ ] Functions do one thing
- [ ] No duplicated code
- [ ] Descriptive names (variables, functions, classes)
- [ ] No magic numbers/strings
- [ ] Dead code removed

### Structure

- [ ] Related code is together
- [ ] Clear module boundaries
- [ ] Dependencies flow in one direction
- [ ] No circular dependencies

### Type Safety

- [ ] Types defined for all public APIs
- [ ] No `any` types without justification
- [ ] Nullable types explicitly marked

### Testing

- [ ] Refactored code is tested
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] All tests pass
